# GoogleGive

GoogleGive is a Google Keep clone that I made with React and Firebase. It only supports creating, editing, and deleting notes.

P.S. It has dark mode :wink:

A demo version is available at: https://give-a5ae5.firebaseapp.com/

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start

Runs the app in development mode on the default port [3000](localhost:3000)

Make sure you run `npm install` before
